# Hi, I'm Donavan

## About Me
I'm a Workday Integrations Architect/Developer currently pursuing my masters degree in [Applied Artificial Intelligence at University of San Diego](https://www.sandiego.edu/engineering/graduate/ms-applied-artificial-intelligence.php). 

## Current Focus
- Leveraging 15+ years of experience trading equities and options to build intelligent trading systems that learn, adapt, and evolve with changing market conditions.

## Capstone Project
- Designing a Market Regime Detection framework using machine learning to classify volatility and structural shifts, enabling adaptive parameter optimization for short-term trading strategies.
